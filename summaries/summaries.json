Non-essential amino acids may provide better resolution of metabolic processing and carbon utilization than conventional bulk SIa . An analysis of aspartate and glutamate may be particularly valu-uablyable for reconstructing bulk diet .  The dominant metabolic- processing routes of source amino acids do not signiicantly fractionate nitrogen because those reactions do not form or break bonds  of nitrogen atoms . There are no nitrogen- associated reactions in the conversion of  methionine to S- adenosylmethionsine or phenylalanine to tyrosine .  Researchers were able to interpret coral amino acid nitrogen isotope values as a proxy for nitrate source . The removal and translocation of the amine functional group during  deamination and transamination are the dominant metabolic processes in the formation of new amino acids via corresponding keto acids . These metabolic processes likely cause nitrogen isotopes to discriminate between the metabolized and remaining amino acids ."

    "summary": " glutamic acid plays a key role in the synthesis of several other amino acids . Nitrogen is transferred from glutamate via transamination to valine, isoleucine, leucine and tyrosine, phenylalanine and aspartic acid, leaving gluta-mate isotopically heavier .  Compound-speciic SIa makes use of the differences in fractionation of trophic and source amino acid to provide an internally indexed indicator of  trophic position . It normalizes for differences in differences in  δ15Nbase. ore reined estimates of trophyic .  Phenylalanine shows little- to- no fractionation across multiple marine and terrestrial taxa in feeding experiments and natural samples, making it an ideal source amino acid . glutamic acid is typically the chosen trophic amino acid for  position calculations, although the mag-ishlynitude of Δ15N can vary among taxa .  There are several important assumptions involved with the  compound- speciic trophic position equation . Variability in β and Δ15NTa are not  well constrained as yet .  Juvenile stingrays have signii-cantly higher δ15N values than adults . Stingrays of all sizes were feeding in isotopically similar habitats but decreased in trophic position as they moved out of the bay as adults ."

King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) and Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) penguins occupied the highest tro-phthalic level . Southern rockhopper penguins were intermediate .  The majority of compound- speciic research in ecogeochemistry has been directed at carbon and nitrogen . Recent work on amino acids suggests compound-speciic deuterium analysis may be a valuable new avenue for studies of movement and foraging .  The large geographic variation in hydrogen in amino acids suggests that analysis of amino acids may provide a valuable new tracer for studies of movement and foraging ecology . Fatty acids represent the main constituent of the majority of lipids found in organisms .  Studies have shown that speciic fatty acid patterns are passed from diet to con-urationsumer for a variety of taxa, from zooplankton and benthic macrofauna to pinnipeds and cetaceans . fatty acid proiles have become a powerful tool for quantitative assessment of predator diets .  This method computes the most likely combination of diet fatty acid signatures that matches the consumer, after accounting for consumer fatty acid metabo-lism (Budge et al. 2012) To be successful, this method requires that the fatty acid compositions of prey species of el to be successful ."

    "summary": " Compound- speciic SIa of fatty acids has the advantage of providing both fatty acid proiles and isotopic information for dietary studies . Stable carbon isotope analysis shows similar patterns to those discussed  for amino acids . Some fatty acids showing signiicant diet- to- consumer discrimination and others showing little to no isotopic change .  Isotopic routing of essential fatty acids provides a record of the isotopic signature of the ietary source preserved in consumer tissues . Ice algae and phytoplankton, the two dominant forms of primary  production fuelling arctic food webs, had distinct differences in fatty acid proiles .  Algae-derived carbon  contributed up to 24% of the carbon passed on to upper trophic levels . This is despite the fact that the majority of the    cholesterol was found to be in the  diet of  poultry and animals .  To enhance the use of isoscapes, we need continued efforts to collect and analyse isotope data throughout the world’s oceans . marine systems are inherently dynamic, and the generation of temporally explicit iopsychisoscapes will greatly enhance the accuracy and scope of ecogeochemistry studies . This is par-ishlyticularly important in light of the growing effects of climate change and ocean acidiication on the iopatic processes in our oceans .  This requires new process-based research to help explain the underlying mechanisms driving spatiotemporal variability in isotopes . We are conident that compound- speciicicSIa will improve the resolution of studies investigating trophic dynamics ."

    "summary": " The Giza layout provides compelling evidence in support of the claim which is made in the Osirian Scripts, to the effect  that the three pyramids were constructed as a centre for the initiation of priest-neophytes . The notion that the Giza pyramids and temples could predate the Fourth Dynasty is likely to find many supporters in orthodox cir cir .  The name of Khufu is found on the internal masonry of the Great Pyramid in no way invalidates this possibility . A king who wished to claim ownership of the monument would have been obliged to adopt the name of the original builder as his own, in order to avoid the need to erase the name .  Khufu raised money by prostituting his own daughter, who being bent on leaving a monument which would perpetuate her own memory, required each man to make her a present of a stone towards the Giza site . Records concerning the delivery of stones to the site have recently been found at the port of Wadi el Jarf on the coast of the Red Sea .  The date of the Fourth Dynasty may seem preposterous to many, but is justified by the Egyptians themselves in documents such as the Turin King List and the history of Manetho . Here we find mention of an era of remote antiquity known as Zep Tepi – the  first Time - when Egypt was ruled by priest-initiates .
